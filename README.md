This is the decompiled source from /system/framework/wifi-service.jar
in Samsung Galaxy Note-10+ Phone (Hong Kong version), for the firmware
released in October 2020. (N9750OZS3DTJ2)

The background decompiling this source code is that a previous version
of it contains evidence
that the code, without knowledge of its owner, forcibly add a new public 
DNS server, 114.114.114.114, controlled by Cogent Communications,
under Nanjing XinFeng Information Technologies Inc, in Mainland China,
when the device is operating in Hong Kong (as well Macau / Mainland China),
and use the server to resolve www.qq.com, a domain owned by Chinese 
tech giant Tencent.

This has caused privacy concerns for some users in Hong Kong.
I claim fair use for posting this copyrighted work, for the purpose of 
criticism, comment, news reporting, and research concerning the Samsung
phones.
